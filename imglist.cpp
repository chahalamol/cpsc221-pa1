 * MISCELLANEOUS FUNCTIONS *
 **************************/

/*
 * This function is NOT part of the ImgList class,
 * but will be useful for one of the ImgList functions.
 * Returns the "difference" between two hue values.
 * PRE: hue1 is a double between [0,360).
 * PRE: hue2 is a double between [0,360).
 *
 * The hue difference is the absolute difference between two hues,
 * but takes into account differences spanning the 360 value.
 * e.g. Two pixels with hues 90 and 110 differ by 20, but
 *      two pixels with hues 5 and 355 differ by 10.

 *          true: render the full width of the original image,

 * PARAM: fillmode - specifies how to fill gaps
 *          0: solid, uses the same colour as the node at the left of the gap
 *          1: solid, using the averaged values (all channels) of the nodes at the left and right of the gap
 *             Note that "average" for hue will use the closer of the angular distances,

 *             Average of diametric hue values will use the smaller of the two averages
 *             e.g. average of 30 and 210 will be 120, and not 280

 *             linear gradient between the colour (all channels) of the nodes at the left and right of the gap

 *             a gap of width 2 will be coloured with 1/3 and 2/3 of the difference
 *             a gap of width 3 will be coloured with 1/4, 2/4, 3/4 of the difference, etc.
 *             Like fillmode 1, use the smaller difference interval for hue,
